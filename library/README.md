# KISS FFT For Android Applications

This repo is created from [kiss-fft](https://github.com/berndporr/kiss-fft) repo, because I need to import the library using GitHub.

## Usage

To use it library in your android application or in your flutter plugin add this repository

```Gradle
maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
```

And then you can add library to your dependencies. Replace `TAG` with tag of latest release
```Gradle
implementation 'com.github.mishkov:kiss-fft-jni:TAG'
```
